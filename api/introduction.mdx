The Marble API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes and verbs.

## Base URL

All API access is over HTTPS and is accessed from the `api.marblecms.com` domain. All data is sent and received as JSON.

```
https://api.marblecms.com/v1/:resource
```

Where `:resource` is the specific resource you want to interact with (e.g., `posts`, `categories`, `tags`, `authors`).

## Authentication

Marble authenticates API requests using API keys. You can create and manage API keys from your workspace dashboard under **Settings > API Keys**.

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.marblecms.com/v1/posts
```

Alternatively, you can pass the API key as a query parameter:

```bash
curl "https://api.marblecms.com/v1/posts?key=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Warning>
  Your API key carries many privileges, so be sure to keep it secure! Do not
  share your API key in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side
  code, and so forth.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Best Practice:** Use the `Authorization` header for all requests. Query
  parameters may be logged in server access logs.
</Tip>

## Response Format

All responses are returned as JSON. Successful responses include the requested data, while errors include an `error` field with details.

<Note>All timestamps are in UTC ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`</Note>

## Error Handling

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of a request:

| Code  | Description                               |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `200` | Success                                   |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters          |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist        |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded   |
| `500` | Internal Server Error                     |

Example error response:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "API key required. Provide via Authorization header or ?key= query parameter"
}
```
