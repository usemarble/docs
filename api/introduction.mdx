The Marble API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes and verbs.

## Base URL

All API access is over HTTPS and is accessed from the `api.marblecms.com` domain. All data is sent and received as JSON.

The structure of a request is: `https://api.marblecms.com/v1/:workspaceKey/:resource`

Where `:workspaceKey` is your unique workspace key, and `:resource` is the specific resource you want to interact with (e.g., `posts`, `categories`, `tags`, etc.).

In the future Marble may support a more fine-grained authentication mechanism using API-Keys, but for now, the workspace key is sufficient.

All timestamps are in UTC ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
