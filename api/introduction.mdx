## What is the Marble API?

The Marble API is a RESTful API for managing headless CMS content. It provides programmatic access to your blog posts, authors, categories, and tags through simple HTTP requests.

The API is organized around REST principles with predictable resource-oriented URLs, JSON-encoded responses, and standard HTTP response codes and verbs.

## Base URL

All API access is over HTTPS and is accessed from the `api.marblecms.com` domain. All data is sent and received as JSON.

```
https://api.marblecms.com/v1/:workspaceKey/:resource
```

Where:
- `:workspaceKey` is your unique workspace key
- `:resource` is the specific resource you want to interact with (e.g., `posts`, `categories`, `tags`)

<Info>
  In the future Marble may support a more fine-grained authentication mechanism using API-Keys, but for now, the workspace key is sufficient.

<Note>
  All timestamps are in UTC ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
