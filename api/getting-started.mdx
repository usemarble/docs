## Trying it out

Throughout this documentation, we use an example workspace ID: `cm6ytuq9x0000i803v0isidst`. You can use this ID to make live API requests and see real responses without needing an account.

<Tip>
  Try it now! Copy and paste this command into your terminal to fetch posts from our example workspace:
</Tip>

```bash
curl https://api.marblecms.com/v1/cm6ytuq9x0000i803v0isidst/posts
```

<Note>
  The example workspace (`cm6ytuq9x0000i803v0isidst`) does not require
  authentication. When you are ready to use your own workspace, you will need to
  use your workspace key in the URL path.
</Note>

## Authentication

When you're ready to use your own workspace, Marble authenticates your API requests using your workspace key in the URL path.

```bash
curl "https://api.marblecms.com/v1/YOUR_WORKSPACE_KEY/posts"
```

<Info>
  Replace `YOUR_WORKSPACE_KEY` with your actual workspace key found in your Marble dashboard under **Settings > General**.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Your workspace key carries many privileges, so be sure to keep it secure! Do not share your workspace key in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
</Warning>
