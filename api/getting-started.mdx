## Trying it out

Throughout this documentation, we use an example workspace ID: `cm6ytuq9x0000i803v0isidst`. You can use this ID to make live API requests and see real responses without needing an account.

<Tip>
  Try it now! Copy and paste this command into your terminal to fetch posts from our example workspace:
</Tip>

```bash
curl https://api.marblecms.com/v1/cm6ytuq9x0000i803v0isidst/posts
```

<Note>
  The example workspace (`cm6ytuq9x0000i803v0isidst`) does not require
  authentication. When you are ready to use your own workspace, you will need to
  use your workspace key in the URL path.
</Note>

## Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```bash
# Simply include your workspace key in the URL path
curl "https://api.marblecms.com/v1/YOUR_WORKSPACE_KEY/posts"
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_WORKSPACE_KEY` with your actual workspace key.

When you're ready to use your own workspace, Marble authenticates your API requests using your workspace key in the URL path. If you do not include your workspace key in the URL, or use one that is incorrect or outdated, Marble returns an error.

The workspace key can be found in your Marble dashboard under `settings > general` and should not be shared publicly.


Your workspace key carries many privileges, so be sure to keep it secure! Do not share your workspace key in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
