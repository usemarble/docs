description: Using webhooks to trigger builds and automate workflows.

Webhooks provide a powerful way to keep your site's content fresh and automate workflows. When an event occurs in your Marble workspace (like publishing a post), we can send an HTTP POST payload to a URL you configure. Webhooks are powered by [Upstash QStash](https://upstash.com?utm_source=marble-docs), ensuring reliable delivery of events.

## Use Cases

### Content Revalidation

For statically generated sites (SSG) built with frameworks like Next.js, Astro, or Nuxt, content is fetched when you build your site. If you update a post in Marble, the change won't be live until you trigger a new deployment.

Webhooks solve this by allowing you to trigger a revalidation of your site's content.

Frameworks like Next.js provide built-in solutions for this, such as [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/incremental-static-regeneration), which can be triggered on-demand by a webhook for instant updates.

### Automating Workflows

Webhooks can also be used to automate other tasks. For example, you could create a serverless function that listens for a `post.published` event from a Marble webhook.

When a new post is published, the webhook sends the post data to your function, which can then:

- Send a newsletter to your subscribers with the new post.
- Share the post on social media.
- Sync the content to another service or backup location.

By listening for specific events, you can build powerful, event-driven automations tailored to your needs.

## Setting Up Webhooks in Marble

1. **Navigate to Webhooks**: On the Marble dashboard, go to the "Webhooks" section.
2. **Create a New Webhook**: Click on "Create Webhook" and fill in the required details:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name for your webhook.
   - **URL**: The endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent.
   - **Format**: Choose the payload format (Currently only JSON is supported).
   - **Events**: Select the events you want to listen for (e.g., `post.published`, `post.updated`).
3. **Save the Webhook**: Once you've filled in the details, save your webhook.
4. **Copy the Webhook Secret**: After creating the webhook, click the 3 dots on the top right and click the ***Copy secret*** button. You will need it to verify the authenticity of incoming requests.

### Verifying Webhook Requests

To ensure that incoming webhook requests are from Marble and haven't been tampered with, you can verify the request using the webhook secret.

If you don't want to copy the verification code into your project, we published an official npm package, `@usemarble/core`, which exports a `verifyMarbleSignature` helper you can use directly. Install it with `npm install @usemarble/core` and then import the helper where needed.

Here's an example of how to verify a webhook request in Next.js using the `crypto` module (or use `verifyMarbleSignature` from `@usemarble/core` instead of copying this function):

```typescript
// lib/marble/webhook.ts
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from "node:crypto";
import { revalidatePath, revalidateTag } from "next/cache";
import type { PostEventData } from "@/types/blog";

export async function handleWebhookEvent(payload: PostEventData) {
  const event = payload.event;
  const data = payload.data;

  // Handle any post.* events (published, updated, deleted, etc.)
  if (event.startsWith("post")) {
    // Revalidate the blog index and the single post page
    revalidatePath("/blog");
    revalidatePath(`/blog/${data.slug}`);

    // If your data fetches use tags, revalidate that tag as well:
    // e.g. fetch(..., { next: { tags: ["posts"] } })
    revalidateTag("posts");

    return {
      revalidated: true,
      now: Date.now(),
      message: "Post event handled",
    };
  }

  return {
    revalidated: false,
    now: Date.now(),
    message: "Event ignored",
  };
}

export function verifySignature(secret: string, signatureHeader: string, bodyText: string) {
  // Strip possible "sha256=" prefix
  const expectedHex = signatureHeader.replace(/^sha256=/, "");

  const computedHex = createHmac("sha256", secret).update(bodyText).digest("hex");

  // Convert to buffers for constant-time compare
  const expected = Buffer.from(expectedHex, "hex");
  const computed = Buffer.from(computedHex, "hex");

  // lengths must match for timingSafeEqual
  if (expected.length !== computed.length) return false;

  return timingSafeEqual(expected, computed);
}
```

```typescript
// app/api/revalidate/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import type { PostEventData } from "@/types/blog";
import { verifySignature, handleWebhookEvent } from "@/lib/marble/webhook";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const signature = request.headers.get("x-marble-signature");
  const secret = process.env.MARBLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET;

  if (!secret || !signature) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Secret or signature missing" }, { status: 400 });
  }

  const bodyText = await request.text();

  if (!verifySignature(secret, signature, bodyText)) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Invalid signature" }, { status: 400 });
  }

  const payload = JSON.parse(bodyText) as PostEventData;
  if (!payload.event || !payload.data) {
    return Response.json(
      { error: "Invalid payload structure" },
      { status: 400 },
    );
  }

  try {
    const result = await handleWebhookEvent(payload);
    return NextResponse.json(result);
  } catch (err) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Failed to process webhook" }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

Marble will send the signature in the `x-marble-signature` header of the request. You can use this signature to verify the authenticity of the request. Make sure to add the `process.env.MARBLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable.

### Request Payload

When a webhook is triggered, Marble sends a POST request to the specified URL with a JSON payload. The payload structure varies depending on the event type. We try to keep the payloads as minimal as possible, only including relevant data.

For `post.published` and `post.updated` events, the payload includes the post title along with the standard fields. Here's an example payload for a `post.published` event:

```json
{
  "event": "post.published",
  "data": {
    "id": "cmf3d1gsv11469tlkp53bcutv",
    "slug": "getting-started-with-marble",
    "title": "Getting Started with Marble CMS",
    "userId": "cms96emp70001l60415sft0i5"
  }
}
```

Here's an example payload for a `tag.deleted` event:

```json
{
  "event": "tag.deleted",
  "data": {
    "id": "cmf3d1gsv11469tlkp53bcutv",
    "slug": "news-and-updates",
    "userId": "cms96emp70001l60415sft0i5"
  }
}
```
This structure is consistent across almost all different event types, with an exeption for `media.*` events, which include a `name` field instead of the `slug`.

## Event Types

Marble supports a variety of event types that you can listen for with webhooks. Here are the currently available events:
- `post.published`: Triggered when a post is published.
- `post.updated`: Triggered when a post is updated.
- `post.deleted`: Triggered when a post is deleted.
- `tag.created`: Triggered when a new tag is created.
- `tag.updated`: Triggered when a tag is updated.
- `tag.deleted`: Triggered when a tag is deleted.
- `category.created`: Triggered when a new category is created.
- `category.updated`: Triggered when a category is updated.
- `category.deleted`: Triggered when a category is deleted.
- `media.deleted`: Triggered when a media file is deleted.

With more events planned for the future, you can stay tuned for updates in the Marble documentation.
