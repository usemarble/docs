## How it works

When you upload media to Marble, your files are stored on a globally distributed CDN. This means:

- **Instant loading** — Images and videos load quickly for readers anywhere in the world
- **Automatic optimization** — Files are served from the edge location closest to your reader
- **No configuration needed** — Just upload and Marble handles the rest

## Using media in your posts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Media Library">
    In the Marble dashboard, click on **Media** in the sidebar to access your
    media library.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Files">
    Click **Upload** to add new images and videos. Files are processed and
    available immediately.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Insert into Posts">
    When editing a post, use the image or video node to insert media from your
    library. You can also paste URLs directly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Accessing media via API

All uploaded media is accessible through the API. When you fetch a post, any embedded images or videos include their CDN URLs:

```json
{
  "id": "cmf3d1gsv11469tlkp53bcutv",
  "title": "My Post with Media",
  "content": "...",
  "featuredImage": {
    "url": "https://media.marblecms.com/featured-image.jpg",
    "alt": "Featured image description"
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  As a rule of thumb, avoid using very large images in your posts. Users with
  slower internet connections will experience longer load times, which can hurt
  engagement.
</Tip>

## Managing your media

From the Media Library, you can:

- **Search and filter** — Find files quickly by name or type
- **Delete unused files** — Remove media you no longer need
- **View file details** — See file size, dimensions, and upload date

<Note>
  Deleting media from the library will break any posts that reference those
  files. Make sure to update your posts before removing media.
