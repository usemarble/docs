Marble's editor is designed to get out of your way. A clean, Notion-like writing experience with no clutter — just you and your content. All metadata and settings live in a collapsible sidebar so you can focus when you need to.

## Writing Experience

The editor opens empty and distraction-free. Start typing and your content takes center stage. Formatting options appear when you need them, and disappear when you don't.

### Formatting

Standard formatting options are available inline:

- **Bold** and _italic_ text
- Text highlights and colors
- Headings (H1 through H6)
- Bullet and numbered lists
- Blockquotes
- Code blocks and inline code
- Links

### Nodes

Beyond text, the editor supports rich content nodes for embedding media:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Images" icon="image">
    Upload images directly or pick from your media library.
  </Card>
  <Card title="YouTube" icon="youtube">
    Embed YouTube videos by pasting a video URL.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Twitter" icon="x-twitter">
    Embed tweets by pasting a tweet URL.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Video" icon="video">
    Upload and embed video files from your media library.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Sidebar

The sidebar keeps metadata and analytics tucked away until you need them. Toggle it open to access two tabs: **Metadata** and **Analysis**.

### Metadata Tab

Control everything about your post without leaving the editor:

| Field            | Description                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Published**    | Toggle to publish or unpublish your post. Unpublished posts are hidden from the API. |
| **Featured**     | Mark a post as featured for special treatment on your site.                          |
| **Cover Image**  | Set a featured image for your post.                                                  |
| **Description**  | A short summary for SEO and previews.                                                |
| **Slug**         | The URL-friendly identifier for your post.                                           |
| **Authors**      | Select one or more authors.                                                          |
| **Tags**         | Add multiple tags to organize content.                                               |
| **Category**     | Assign a single category.                                                            |
| **Published On** | Set or schedule the publish date.                                                    |
| **Attribution**  | Add source attribution if needed.                                                    |

### Analysis Tab

The Analysis tab gives you real-time feedback on your writing with text statistics and AI-powered suggestions.

**Text Statistics:**

- Word count
- Sentence count
- Words per sentence
- Estimated reading time

## Content AI

Marble's Content AI acts like a writing instructor, giving you a readability score and actionable suggestions to improve your content.

### Readability Score

Every post gets a score based on the **Flesch Reading Ease** formula — a widely used standard for measuring how easy a document is to read. The higher the score, the more accessible your writing.

### Writing Suggestions

The AI analyzes your content and surfaces suggestions in the sidebar:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sentence Structure" icon="paragraph">
    Break long sentences into two to keep your writing crisp and improve pacing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Vocabulary" icon="book">
    Simplify complex words for quicker reading.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Filler Phrases" icon="scissors">
    Cut softening phrases to tighten flow and maintain focus.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Opening Lines" icon="sparkles">
    Get feedback on your opening to hook readers from the first sentence.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Click on any suggestion to highlight the affected paragraph, sentence, or word in the editor. Make changes directly in your content, or ignore suggestions that don't fit your style.

<Tip>
  Content AI works best as a second pair of eyes. Write naturally first, then
  review the suggestions to polish your content.
