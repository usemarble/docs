title: Import Markdown and MDX to Marble CMS
description: Import existing Markdown and MDX files to Marble CMS. Supports headings, lists, links, images, code blocks, and preserves MDX components for your application.

You can bring your existing `.md` and `.mdx` files into Marble. During import, Marble preserves the most commonly used Markdown and MDX syntax so you do not have to rewrite your content.

## Supported Markdown syntax

The following core Markdown features are **preserved on import**:

| Syntax                     | Import | Editor |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Headings                  | ✅     | ✅     |
| Paragraphs & line breaks  | ✅     | ✅     |
| Emphasis                  | ✅     | ✅     |
| Unordered lists           | ✅     | ✅     |
| Ordered lists             | ✅     | ✅     |
| Links                     | ✅     | ✅     |
| Images                    | ✅     | ✅     |
| Blockquotes               | ✅     | ✅     |
| Code blocks               | ✅     | ✅     |
| Inline code               | ✅     | ✅     |
| Tables                    | ❌     | ❌     |

Importing unsupported syntax might not display properly.

## MDX and components

If your content uses MDX, Marble will keep JSX-style components and custom MDX syntax **in the source**:

- MDX elements like `<MyComponent prop="value" />`
- Shortcodes or layout wrappers used in `.mdx` files

However:

- ❌ **Custom components will not render inside the Marble editor preview.**
- ❌ **Marble does not execute or parse your components for you.** You need to parse the imported MDX inside your own codebase (for example, using your framework’s MDX pipeline) for those components to work at runtime.

You can safely import your existing Markdown (`.md`) and MDX (`.mdx`) files into Marble. The supported Markdown syntax above is preserved during import, and MDX components remain in the source so they continue to work when parsed in your own application.
