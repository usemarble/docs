Use our official SDK for a streamlined development experience with full type safety and convenient helper methods.

<Info>
  We're actively developing official SDKs. In the meantime, you can use the
  [REST API](/api/introduction) directly or import TypeScript types from
  `@usemarble/core`.

## TypeScript Types

While we work on a full SDK, you can use our published TypeScript types for type-safe development:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm install @usemarble/core
  ```

```bash yarn
yarn add @usemarble/core
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @usemarble/core
```

```bash bun
bun add @usemarble/core
```

</CodeGroup>

```typescript
import type {
  MarblePost,
  MarbleCategory,
  MarbleTag,
  MarbleAuthor,
  MarblePagination,
} from "@usemarble/core";

// Use types with fetch
const response = await fetch("https://api.marblecms.com/v1/posts", {
  headers: { Authorization: process.env.MARBLE_API_KEY },
});
const data: { posts: MarblePost[]; pagination: MarblePagination } =
  await response.json();
```

For full type definitions, see the [TypeScript Types](/api/types) reference.

## Coming Soon

We're building official SDKs with convenient methods, automatic retries, and built-in pagination helpers.
