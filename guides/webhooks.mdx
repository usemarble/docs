Webhooks provide a powerful way to keep your site's content fresh and automate workflows. When an event occurs in your MarbleCMS workspace (like publishing a post), we can send an HTTP POST payload to a URL you configure.

  Webhooks are currently under active development. The data structure and
  available events are subject to change. This guide outlines the intended
  functionality.

## Use Cases

### Content Revalidation

For statically generated sites (SSG) built with frameworks like Next.js, Astro, or Nuxt, content is fetched when you build your site. If you update a post in MarbleCMS, the change won't be live until you trigger a new deployment.

Webhooks solve this by allowing you to trigger a revalidation of your site's content.

Frameworks like Next.js provide built-in solutions for this, such as [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/incremental-static-regeneration), which can be triggered on-demand by a webhook for instant updates.

### Automating Workflows

Webhooks can also be used to automate other tasks. For example, you could create a serverless function that listens for a `post.published` event from a MarbleCMS webhook.

When a new post is published, the webhook sends the post data to your function, which can then:

- Send a newsletter to your subscribers with the new post.
- Share the post on social media.
- Sync the content to another service or backup location.

By listening for specific events, you can build powerful, event-driven automations tailored to your needs.
