<Step title="Create an account">

<Step title="Create a workspace">
After signing up, you'll be prompted to create your first workspace.

<Note>
  **What is a workspace?** Think of a workspace as a container for all the
  content related to a single project, like your personal blog or a company
  website. Each workspace holds its own posts, media, tags, categories, and team
  members.
</Note>

Give your workspace a name (you can always change it later) and click **Create Workspace**.

<Step title="Explore the dashboard">
Once your workspace is ready, youâ€™ll be taken to the dashboard. This is your central hub for managing content. From here, you can create posts, upload media, and invite teammates.

</Step>

<Step title="Create your first post">
Click **New Post** to open the editor. The editor provides a clean, minimal interface where you can write in Markdown, add images from your media library, and organize your content with tags and categories.

When you're ready, you can save your post as a draft or publish it immediately.
